It’s such horseshit that Billboard rewards that behavior and punishes Drizzy for making a half-assed mixtape full of songs he’d already dropped on SoundCloud. How the hell is ‘Toosie Slide’ going to compare to a song that the artist thought about for more than 15 minutes?” At press time, Drake released a statement asking fans to ignore Kenny Chesney and focus on the horseshit that he just released.\"\"\"]\n",
